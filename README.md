# Bouncing

> A dvd-bouncer style animation in Love2D with custom physics and collision 
> My first project in lua and Love2D. It has custom physics and collision 

# How to play? 

> Open the Game folder, and launch the Game.exe file. That's it - enjoy!

# How to build

> Alternatively, it you want to build the game yourself or tinker with its code, you have the boucning/ folder with all the code
> You'll need Love2d installed on your device: https://www.love2d.org/
> Love2d's docs explain quite well how to open a project: https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started
